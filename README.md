Cornhusker Crime

Reefer Madness

It seems that the storm of U.S. Politic News has been unavoidable recently. The new Attorney General has been in the spotlight since his nomination. "Nevertheless, she persited" when Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D--MA). Then there was the self-inforced error when he asserting that he had not been in contact with the Russians. This was in response to an objective straightforward question from (his words), "Sweet" Sen. Al Franken (D -- MN), during Sessions confirmation hearing. Franken's question had nothing to do with whether or not Sessions had met with anybody from Russia, or any one else for that matter. Many Dems thought Sessions doth protest too much.

After his nomination to Attorny General, Sessions has wasted no time making public that the Department of Justice will be 'Tough on Crime' under his watch. In particular, he has repeatedly referenced marjijuana as a serious problem. If the steady trend in states that have legalized marijuana, and national polling numbers are any indication, he seems to already be on the wrong side of history. The "War on Drugs" popularized by "Just Say No", Nancy Reagan, was not a success. In fact, the majority of Americans are now in favor of legalizing marijuana.

As a quantitative data sciency type, a recent quote struck me as questionable. The link latest quote struck me as \_\_\_\_. \[\]

the "war on drugs" was a failure, with rates of drug use unchanged since President Richard Nixon launched the campaign more than 40 years ago.
